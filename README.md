# UML Use Case Diagram (Library System)

OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
This is an UML use case diagram project of a library system for the [Oriented Object Project and Analysis] course. The purpose of the project was to make a monography with a use case diagram, description of the use cases and to learn how to use a Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) application. It was made at the Computer Science undergraduate program from University of SÃ£o Paulo (ICMC - USP).

REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
--------------------------------------------------
```bash
  1) Elaborate a Use Case Diagram of the system along with a table associating the use cases with the respective requirements covered.
  2) In the same table of item 1, describe all use cases in a summarized way.
  3) Describe the Use Cases in Abstract Full format for at least three use cases.
```
* Please check the file `Requirements Document.pdf` for a complete description of the project.

REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT PURPOSE
